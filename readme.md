Welcome to the Hylaine Tech screen.

General tips:
* Finish as much as you can, though 100% completion is **not** required. I’d focus on completing the 
	“Crossword Solver” challenge and using it as a scratchpad if necessary for the other problems.
* The target completion time is within 4 business days, or the weekend + 2 full business days.
	Please submit after around 5 hours of work - if you need extra time or the screen is taking
	much longer than that please let us know. In general, we wish to be respectful of your time and ensure
	that all applicants expend similar amounts of effort.
* The solution should open in any editor, and is targets .NET Core so should compile and run with the correct
	tooling.
* Most of the questions are self-explanatory with comments inside each one. Some require you to write code, 
	others ask for your comments. Please prepend your comments with your initials.
* Any and all feedback is welcomed/encouraged. If you have questions feel free to ask - this helps us
	improve our prompts if necessary.
* When you return the screen, please do so in an archive named "{Your Name} - Hylaine.zip". You may use the included 
	powershell scripts to remove bin and obj folders.
